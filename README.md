Homework 10: Node.js & MySQL for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. Project contains 3 javascript files that interact with a MySQL database in different ways. The MySQL database contains a mock store with added products. The customer file lets you act as a customer, letting you buy items. The manager file lets you view all prodcuts, view low inventory, add to the inventory, and add a new product. The supervisor view adds a new departments table, letting you view product sales by department and create a new department. 
   
## Getting Started

All MySQL code is stored in the schema.sql file. Run the code intially to set up 2 databases, a product one and a department one. The customer and manager files interact with only the product database; the supervisor file interacts with both.
