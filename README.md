Homework 10: Node.js & MySQL for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. Project contains 3 javascript files that interact with a MySQL database in different ways. The MySQL database contains a mock store with added products. The customer file lets you act as a customer, letting you buy items. The manager file lets you view all prodcuts, view low inventory, add to the inventory, and add a new product. The supervisor view adds a new departments table, letting you view product sales by department and create a new department.
